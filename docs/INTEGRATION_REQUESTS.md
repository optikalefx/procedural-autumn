# Integration requests

System authors: append here when you need a change to a file you do not own
(`src/main.js`, `src/core/*`, `src/world/WorldData.js`, another module).
Include: what you need, why, and how you worked around it meanwhile.

## Sky / Atmosphere / Lighting

**1. Renderer shadow-map type.** `Lighting` needs to choose the shadow filter
(it owns the light, the bias and the cascade extent) but `renderer` lives in
`Engine`, which system authors do not edit. Right now `Lighting._configureShadows()`
late-binds through `globalThis.__engine` on the first frame and forces a
material recompile, which costs one hitch at boot. Request: pass the renderer
(or an `engine` handle) to `new Lighting(scene, quality)`, or move
`shadowMap.type` into a value Engine reads from Lighting.
*Workaround in place; no action needed to ship.*

**2. Wrap / half-Lambert term on the key light.** The reference art has a soft
shadow terminator on foliage and terrain. That needs a `dot(N,L)` wrap in the
lighting chunks, which no single system author can add without editing
`THREE.ShaderChunk` lighting code that everyone shares. Atmosphere already owns
the global `fog_*` chunk patch; if the team agrees, the same file could patch
`lights_lambert_*` / `lights_physical_*` to add a wrap factor driven by one
uniform. Not done unilaterally. Currently approximated by lifting the
hemisphere fill and adding a counter-key directional.

**3. Bloom threshold vs. the sky.** `PostFX` runs bloom *after* AgX with
`luminanceThreshold: 0.62`, so any large sky area brighter than ~0.62 display
self-blooms and clips to white. The sky and cloud keyframes are authored under
that ceiling. If PostFX ever raises the threshold or moves bloom before tone
mapping, the sky keyframes in `Lighting.js` should be re-brightened by ~20%.

**4. (terrain, FYI)** As of this writing the terrain `MeshStandardMaterial`
fails to compile: `ERROR: 0:105: 'patch' : Illegal use of reserved word` —
`patch` is a reserved word in GLSL ES. Renaming the helper fixes it. Not my
file, flagged here because it blanks the ground in every capture.
> **Terrain author: fixed.** Helper renamed to `massEdge`. Thank you — that
> saved a whole round. Ground compiles and renders again.

**`tools/terrain-lab.mjs` droplet count.** Bumped the lab's erosion budget from
`RES*RES*0.14` to `RES*RES*0.22` so it matches what `TerrainGen.generate()` now
runs. The lab is only useful as an instrument if it bakes the shipped world.

**Water surface flatness (`Water.js` owner).** `TerrainGen` now only marks a
cell as lake when the priority-flood had to raise it by more than 0.55 m (was
0.12 m), so the epsilon flats no longer sheet water across level meadow. Lake
count is down ~4x. Remaining small lakes still render as hard-edged flat quads
floating above the ground in wide shots — worth a shoreline fade.

**Distant terrain shadows.** Terrain chunks now cast shadows out to LOD 2
(~720 m) instead of LOD 1, because valley-crossing massif shadows are a
signature of the reference art. If the shadow-map budget gets tight, this is a
cheap thing to pull back.
